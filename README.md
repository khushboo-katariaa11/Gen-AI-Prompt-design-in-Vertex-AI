# üåê Generative AI with Vertex AI & Gemini ‚Äì Hands-on Labs  

## üìå Overview  
This repository documents my learnings from the **Google Cloud Gen AI Exchange Program**.  
I explored **Vertex AI Studio, Gemini models, and Google Gen AI SDK** through self-paced labs and challenge exercises.  

The program focused on:  
- **Prompt Engineering & Best Practices (SP1151)**  
- **Application Prototyping in Vertex AI Studio (GSP1154)**  
- **Challenge Lab: Prompt Design in Vertex AI (GSP519)**

# Challenge Lab Reflection ‚Äì GSP519  

The challenge lab tested my ability to apply skills without guided instructions.  

### Tasks Completed:  
1. Designed prompts for **marketing content generation** (product descriptions & taglines).  
2. Used Gemini models for creative + concise outputs.  
3. Exported generated code from Vertex AI Studio into Python SDK format.  
4. Debugged issues independently by adjusting parameters and refining prompts.  

### Key Takeaways:  
- Prompt wording changes drastically affect model outputs.  
- Understanding **system instructions** is crucial for consistent results.  
- Debugging in real-time taught me to **experiment with parameters** and **read error messages carefully**.  
- Challenge labs simulate how real-world AI projects require flexibility, research, and self-learning.
